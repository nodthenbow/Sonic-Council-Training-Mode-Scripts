These are helpful training mode tool scripts for Sokkou Seitokai - Sonic Council, to be run with Bizhawk 2.10

Hash for game files:

Folder name: "Sokkou Seitokai - Sonic Council (Japan)"

SHA256 checksum for data and names: e2394185d08792923044f912a263e71e7ca5d3a8f7bad234214a98ae74dd6490-00000009

Although as far as I know there is only one version of the game.

Might not work with future versions of BizHawk, and I probably will not update the scripts to fix that. 

Scripts have a comment at the start of the scripts explaining stuff about them. The notes and watch files are what I was making while doing the reverse engineering, they aren't needed at all for using the scripts (I put them here so anyone who wants to make new scripts doesn't start from literally nothing).

I made use of https://github.com/VGKintsugi/Ghidra-SegaSaturn-Loader and Ghidra, as well as Mednafen and Bizhawk to figure out how things worked.

Free to use in any way without attribution, although I would like it if you did give me credit and maybe even linked back to this repo (even added as a comment in the scripts is fine).
